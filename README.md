| CEO | The Chief Executive Officer of the company. The highest ranking execxutive within the company | They set the company's vision, make key decisions, are accountable to the board of directors and stakeholders and responsible for its overall management and strategic direction. This is level of decision making power is why they are very high in terms of influence, but due to their oversight of everything within the company, they may not have the application development as their highest interest, hence why it is better to keep him satisfied |
| Devs | The people responsible for developing the application and ensuring that it is to a satisfactory standard for all stakeholders | They will naturally have a higher interest in the project as they are the people developing the entire application, including all its features and security. They will want the application to be the best it can be, but unfortunately will not have that much influence or decision making power as they are not high up in the company hierarchy, hence why they need to be informed |
| Customers | Main users of the application. The people who want their finances managed | They float inbetween 'keep informed' and 'actively engaged' as they are the main users of the application. They are also the people that can give feedback on the application and areas that the application could improve on, which partly plays to them being higher up in influence than developers |
